## Kafka vs Kafka Streams: What's the Difference?

Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that enables you to build real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. Kafka Streams, on the other hand, is a client library for building stream processing applications on top of Kafka. In essence, Kafka is the foundation, and Kafka Streams is a tool to build on top of that foundation. Think of Kafka as a highway and Kafka Streams as a car. You need the highway to get from point A to point B, and you need a car to travel the highway.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Kafka:** A distributed, fault-tolerant, high-throughput platform for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. Handles the message broker role.
*   **Kafka Streams:** A lightweight stream processing library built on top of Kafka. Enables you to build stateful stream processing applications that consume data from Kafka topics.

## Why Choose Kafka Streams?

Kafka Streams offers several advantages for building stream processing applications:

*   **Simplicity:** Easy to learn and use, with a simple API.
*   **Scalability:** Can scale to handle large amounts of data.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Built on top of Kafka, which is fault-tolerant.
*   **Stateful Processing:** Supports stateful stream processing, allowing you to perform complex aggregations and transformations.

The linked course explores these concepts in detail and provides practical examples to get you started.
