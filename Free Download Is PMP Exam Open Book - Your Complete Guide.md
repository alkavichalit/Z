## Understanding the PMP Exam Format

The PMP (Project Management Professional) exam is a challenging, proctored exam designed to test your knowledge and application of project management principles. It's based on the *PMBOK® Guide* and other relevant sources. So, **is it open book? Officially, no.** You cannot bring any external materials like books, notes, or devices into the exam room. The exam is designed to assess your understanding of project management concepts, not your ability to look them up.

## What to Expect During the PMP Exam

The PMP exam consists of 180 questions (combination of multiple-choice, multiple responses, matching, hotspot and limited fill-in-the-blank questions) that cover various project management domains as outlined in the *PMBOK® Guide*. You'll have roughly 230 minutes to complete the exam. The exam is administered at Pearson VUE testing centers under strict supervision. You will be provided with an on-screen calculator, but outside calculators are prohibited.
